Pronto runner for [Brakeman](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman), security vulnerability scanner for RoR. [What is Pronto?](https://github.com/prontolabs/pronto)

## Severity mapping

Brakeman [Confidence](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman#confidence-levels) is mapped to severity levels on the
messages generated by Pronto. High confidence maps to fatal, medium confidence maps to warning, and low confidence maps
to info.

# Options
Brakeman also includes some optional checks and by setting the following in your `.pronto.yml` you can run every check included in the gem:

## Running in a Subdirectory

```yaml
brakeman:
  path: "some_folder/"
```

## Run all checks

```yaml
brakeman:
  run_all_checks: true
```

(This is the equivalent of running `brakeman -A` on the command line.)

## Ignore file

```yaml
brakeman:
  ignore_file: '.brakeman'
```

(This is the equivalent of running `brakeman -i IGNOREFILE` on the command line.)

## Extra Brakeman configuration

You can define additional Brakeman configuration by creating a [`config/brakeman.yml` file](https://brakemanscanner.org/docs/options/#configuration-files). This file will be automatically loaded by Brakeman.

For example, if you want to run Brakeman with the following options `brakeman --run-all-checks --rails6 --branch-limit -1` you can use the `--create-config` flag to generate the `config/brakeman.yml` file, and it will look something like this:

```yaml
---
:run_all_checks: true
:rails3: true
:rails4: true
:rails5: true
:rails6: true
:branch_limit: -1
```
